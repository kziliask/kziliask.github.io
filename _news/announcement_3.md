Our paper has been accepted at [Winter Simulation Conference 2025](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/wsc2025/). The paper, titled "Bridging the Gap: A Practical Guide to Implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning Simulation in Operations Research with Gymnasium", is a tutorial-track paper that provides a comprehensive overview of using Gymnasium for simulation in operations research. The conference will be held in Seattle, WA, from December 7-10, 2025. I am excited to share our findings and contribute to the discussions on simulation and operations research methodologies.
