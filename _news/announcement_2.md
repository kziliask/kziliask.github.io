I will be attending the [2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting](https://meetings.informs.org/annual/2025/) in Atlanta, GA, from October 26-29, 2025. I will be presenting my research on "Neural Network Validation through Mixed Integer Programming" in the session on "Generative AI". Looking forward to connecting with fellow researchers and practitioners in the field!
