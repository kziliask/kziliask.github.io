I am honored to have been awarded the Chapman Travel Award for the Winter Simulation Conference 2025. This award will support my participation in the conference, where I will present our paper titled "Bridging the Gap: A Practical Guide to Implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning Simulation in Operations Research with Gymnasium". The conference will take place in Seattle, WA, from December 7-10, 2025. I look forward to engaging with fellow researchers and practitioners in the field of simulation and operations research!
